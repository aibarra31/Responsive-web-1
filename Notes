Alish's notes on Pham's project

    Your logo was not being taken off when re-sized to a phone.

    Great job on the background but it made the page over crowded and you could only see bits and pieces. I tried making the background
    transparent and different color to the text but it didn't work

    You had great animation for the logo

    The class botton you didn't keep on your css but kept it in your HTML

    You needed to add padding to your paragraphs and body.

    Your footer needed to be centered

    It would have worked better if your text filled in the dead space around your pictures.

    I added borders originally to your paragraphs then took them off

    Great hover animations on your navigation, you know how to use them well.

    The color scheme stayed true to anime theme, especially with the background, however next time I would suggest brighter colors

    I don't think that you needed to specify Text decoration in your navigation buttons or the list style type

    #anime img you didn't need to specify the width @24%

    Padding left on information b was not needed but I would have adjusted the padding on all
